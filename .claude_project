## CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

### Session Start Protocol (MANDATORY)
1. **ALWAYS read docs/CONTINUATION.md FIRST** - Get current state and next steps
2. **Read CLAUDE.md** - Understand process rules and workflows
3. **Read this file (.claude_project)** - Get project context
4. **State current context** - [branch: ... | issue: #... | status: ...]
5. **Proceed with workflow** - Make changes, test, commit

### Project-Specific Data Integrity
**Website Content Rules:**
```
- NEVER change brand name from RideCareShare
- Primary domain: ridecareshare.com (also ridesharetogether.com points here)
- Founder name: Vadim
- Keep design pattern: muted earth tones, smooth transitions, accessible
- Mobile app development is SEPARATE repository - not covered here
```

### Safety Defaults
**Deployment and Content Defaults:**
```
- Default to GitHub Pages for hosting
- Default to static HTML/CSS/JS (no build process)
- Default to responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Test on multiple browsers before deployment
```

### Documentation Enforcement (MANDATORY)
- **PROGRESS.md** - MUST update when completing any issue
- **CONTINUATION.md** - MUST update when switching tasks or completing work
- **Both files** - MUST be updated before committing with "Complete Issue #" or "Closes #"
- **State tracking** - MUST include [branch: ... | issue: #... | status: ...] in every response

### STRICTLY PROHIBITED APPROACHES - NO EXCEPTIONS
**Always fix the root problem. These workarounds are NEVER acceptable:**
- ❌ **Adding unnecessary dependencies** - Keep it static and simple
- ❌ **Overcomplicating the design** - This is a pre-launch landing page
- ❌ **Breaking responsive design** - Must work on all devices
- ❌ **Ignoring accessibility** - All users must be able to navigate
- ❌ **Hardcoding API keys or secrets** - Never commit sensitive data
- ❌ **Breaking SEO best practices** - Page must be discoverable

See CLAUDE.md "RED FLAGS" section for full details.

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### Core Architectural Rule
**SIMPLICITY FIRST - Static, Fast, Accessible**

This is a pre-launch landing page for RideCareShare mobile app. The website serves these purposes:
1. Introduce the concept to potential users
2. Collect waitlist signups
3. Provide social media links for ongoing communication
4. Professional first impression before mobile app launch

**✅ Correct Pattern**: Single `index.html` file with embedded CSS/JS, no dependencies, fast loading, mobile-responsive
**❌ Prohibited Pattern**: Adding frameworks (React, Vue, etc.), build processes, or unnecessary complexity

### Project Structure (v1.0.0)

```

### Clean Separation (ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARIES)
```
- Website (this repo): Pre-launch landing page, static content, waitlist collection
- Mobile App (separate repo): Actual RideCareShare application development
- No duplication: Website is purely informational, app handles all functionality
```

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Primary Development Process
**Static File Development:**
```
1. Edit index.html directly in code editor
2. Open index.html in browser to preview
3. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Test responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. Validate HTML/CSS using browser DevTools
6. Commit changes with descriptive messages
7. Push to GitHub (auto-deploys to GitHub Pages)
```

### Command Structure & Scripts

#### Development Commands
```bash
# Open in browser for testing
open index.html
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000  # Simple local server

# Validate HTML (if w3c validator installed)
# Visit: https://validator.w3.org/
```

#### Quality Assurance Commands
```bash
# Check browser console for JavaScript errors
# Use browser DevTools (F12)

# Test responsive design
# Use browser DevTools device toolbar (Cmd+Shift+M)

# Accessibility testing
# Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
```

## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

### Environment Variables
**No environment variables needed** - This is a static site with no backend.

Email collection will be handled via:
- TODO: Set up email service (FormSpree, EmailJS, or custom backend)
- Currently logs to console for testing

### Configuration Files
```
- index.html: Complete website (HTML, CSS, JS all in one)
- .gitignore: Ignore system files (.DS_Store, etc.)
- README.md: Project documentation and setup instructions
```

---

## STATIC WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE

### Single-Page Design
**All content in index.html:**
```
- Header: Logo, theme toggle
- Hero: Main value proposition, CTA buttons
- Problem: Three crises being addressed
- Solution: How RideCareShare works
- Features: Key features grid
- How It Works: Step-by-step process
- Impact: Projected social impact
- Founder: Vadim's story and motivation
- Testimonials: Early user feedback
- Waitlist: Signup form
- Footer: Copyright, social media links
```

### Theme System
**Dark/Light mode toggle:**
```javascript
- CSS variables for theming (--bg-primary, --text-primary, etc.)
- localStorage persistence for user preference
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Accessible color contrast in both modes
```

### Social Media Integration
**Footer social links:**
```
- Facebook: https://facebook.com (to be updated with actual account)
- X (Twitter): https://twitter.com (to be updated with actual account)
- Instagram: https://instagram.com (to be updated with actual account)
- YouTube: https://youtube.com (to be updated with actual account)
```

---

## DATA & STATE MANAGEMENT

### Client-Side State
**Minimal state management:**
```javascript
- Theme preference: Stored in localStorage
- Waitlist form data: Captured and logged (awaiting email service integration)
- Smooth scroll: JavaScript for anchor link navigation
```

### No Database Required
This is a static landing page. Waitlist submissions will eventually integrate with an email service provider, but no database is needed for the website itself.

---

## DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONS

### GitHub Pages Deployment
**Automatic deployment process:**
```bash
# 1. Ensure main branch is up to date
git status
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push origin main

# 2. GitHub Pages automatically deploys from main branch
# 3. Site available at: https://vadimgumarov.github.io/ridecareshare_web/

# 4. Custom domain setup (after DNS configuration):
# - ridecareshare.com (primary)
# - ridesharetogether.com (redirect to primary)
```

### Service URLs & Endpoints
```
Development:
- Local: file:///Users/vadim/Desktop/Projects/RIDECARESHARE_WEB/index.html
- Local server (optional): http://localhost:8000

Production:
- GitHub Pages: https://vadimgumarov.github.io/ridecareshare_web/
- Custom Domain (primary): https://ridecareshare.com
- Custom Domain (secondary): https://ridesharetogether.com

## TESTING STRATEGY (MANUAL)

### Browser Testing
```
Required browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest, macOS/iOS)
- Edge (latest)

Test checklist:
1. All sections render correctly
2. Theme toggle works (light/dark mode)
3. Smooth scroll navigation functions
4. Waitlist form captures data
5. Social media links open in new tabs
6. Responsive design works (mobile, tablet, desktop)
7. No JavaScript console errors
8. Fast page load (< 2 seconds)
```

### Accessibility Testing
```
- Use Chrome Lighthouse for accessibility audit
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Test screen reader compatibility (VoiceOver on macOS)
- Verify sufficient color contrast in both themes
- Ensure all images have alt text (when added)
- Verify ARIA labels on interactive elements
```

### Performance Testing
```
- Lighthouse performance score > 90
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- No render-blocking resources
```

## SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### Security Requirements
```
- No authentication needed (static site)
- No sensitive data stored (waitlist emails sent to service)
- HTTPS enforced via GitHub Pages
- Content Security Policy via meta tags (if needed)
- No third-party scripts (privacy-friendly)
```

### Privacy & Data Collection
```
- Waitlist form: Name and email only
- No tracking scripts or analytics (unless explicitly added)
- No cookies (except localStorage for theme preference)
- Privacy-first approach
```

---

## MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY

### Manual Monitoring
```
- Browser DevTools console for errors
- GitHub Pages deployment status
- Manual testing after each deployment
- User feedback via social media
```

### SEO & Discoverability
```
- Meta tags for title, description
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Semantic HTML structure
- Mobile-friendly design (Google ranking factor)
- Fast loading speed (Google ranking factor)
```
