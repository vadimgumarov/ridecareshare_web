# CONTINUATION.md - RideCareShare Website

## Current Status
- Working on: Initial project setup and deployment preparation
- Branch: main
- Test Status: Manual testing required before deployment
- Last session: Completed core website setup with branding, social media icons, and configuration files
- Current focus: Finalizing documentation and preparing for GitHub Pages deployment

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete initial git commit with all project files
2. Push to GitHub repository (https://github.com/vadimgumarov/ridecareshare_web)
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Test deployed website on GitHub Pages URL
5. Create deployment guides for custom domain setup
6. Create social media deployment plan

## Context & Recent Decisions
- **Branding**: Changed from RideCareTogether to RideCareShare across all content
- **Primary Domain**: ridecareshare.com (ridesharetogether.com will redirect to same site)
- **Founder**: Vadim
- **Architecture**: Single static HTML file with embedded CSS/JS for simplicity and performance
- **Design Pattern**: Muted earth tones, smooth transitions, accessible, responsive
- **Social Media**: Icons added to footer, accounts to be created (Facebook, X, Instagram, YouTube)
- **Email Service**: Waitlist form prepared, email integration pending (FormSpree, EmailJS, or custom backend)

## Website Status & Coverage
- Landing page: 100% complete with all sections
- Theme toggle: Functional (light/dark mode with localStorage persistence)
- Waitlist form: UI complete, backend integration pending
- Social media links: Placeholder URLs ready for account creation
- Responsive design: Mobile-first approach implemented
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels in place

## Session Handoff Notes
- **Next deployment step**: Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages
- **Domain configuration**: Will require DNS setup after GitHub Pages is live
- **Email service**: Need to choose and integrate email service for waitlist (options: FormSpree free tier, EmailJS, or custom backend)
- **Social media accounts**: Create accounts and update URLs in footer (currently pointing to main platform pages)
- **Testing**: Manual browser testing required on Chrome, Firefox, Safari before considering production-ready
- **Future enhancements**: Logo/branding images, 60-second video, charity partner logos, analytics integration

## Known Issues
- No issues currently identified
- Website is functional and ready for deployment
- External integrations (email, social media) are pending setup
